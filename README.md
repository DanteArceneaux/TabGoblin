# Tab Goblin

A Chrome Side Panel extension featuring a pixel-art goblin companion that reacts to your browsing habits.

## Overview

Tab Goblin is a productivity companion that lives in your Chrome Side Panel. The goblin transforms based on how many tabs you have open:

- **0-10 Tabs**: Cute baby goblin (Happy and healthy)
- **10-25 Tabs**: Greedy teen goblin (Hoarding tabs like treasure)
- **25-50 Tabs**: Glitching monster (Corrupted by too many tabs)
- **50+ Tabs**: Death state (Game over)

Closing tabs "feeds" the goblin and grants XP, helping it evolve through different forms.

## Features

- **Real-time Tab Monitoring**: Reacts instantly to tab changes
- **Evolution System**: Goblin evolves as you feed it by closing tabs
- **Persistent State**: Your goblin's progress is saved across browser sessions
- **Procedural Audio**: Chiptune sound effects generated in real-time
- **Focus Mode**: Pause the game when you need to work with many tabs
